            ' K Means Clustering "Unsupervised" '
python machine learning : Here i am showing how k means clustering works.
K means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that attempts 
to split training data into k unique clusters. 


we don't feed the labels from datapoints when were trainig the model , 
we just give a bunch of features  that make one point .we dont say which point is which .
we just deliver digits and computer has to figure out  what makes what digit.

But in previous algorithms , we said what made up a digit and were giving the digit 
x in the digaram called centroids :detemine what giving a data point and 
what cluster that belongs to see
